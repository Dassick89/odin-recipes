<h4>Warm French Bread Recipe!</h4>
<p>This French bread recipe yields hot, fresh loaves with a crisp, crunchy crust and slightly chewy center. This bread is as traditional as the bread served in France.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4> 
<!--Unordered list is useful to show multiple items in no order-->
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon cornmeal</li>
  <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 ½ (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
  <li>2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
  <li>1 egg white</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
<!--Ordered list adds numbers to each line in order to show steps-->
<ol>
  <li>Grease a large baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal. Set aside. </li>
  <li>Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir in 2 cups warm water; beat with the dough hook attachment until blended. Continue adding remaining flour, a little at a time, until incorporated. </li>
  <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a greased bowl, and turn once. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
  <li>Punch dough down and divide in half. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. </li>
  <li>Roll each half into a large rectangle. Roll up, starting from a long side. Moisten edge with water and seal. Taper ends. </li>
  <li>Place loaves, seam-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly beat egg white with 1 tablespoon water and brush over loaves. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until nearly doubled, 35 to 40 minutes. </li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
  <li>Use a sharp knife to make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts, about 1/4-inch deep, across top of each loaf. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Brush loaves with egg white mixture. Continue baking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 190 degrees F (88 degrees C) or loaves sound hollow when tapped, 15 to 20 minutes more. If necessary, cover loosely with foil to prevent over-browning. </li>
  <li>Remove loaves from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack. </li>
